1. Create a directory on the machine where the tracing is going to run - example c:\ms

2. Copy lsass_idna_start.cmd.txt and lsass_idna_start.cmd.txt to target and remove .txt extension

3. Download the latest vesion of time travel tracing tool from \\dbg\privates\LKG\partner\PartnerTTDRecorder_x86_x64.zip and save it in c:\ms

4. Unzip PartnerTTDRecorder_x86_x64.zip 

5. 
If you are running 64 bit OS version, copy lsass_idna_start.cmd to c:\ms\TTT\amd64\TTD
If you are running 32 bit OS version, copy lsass_idna_start.cmd to c:\ms\TTT\x86\TTD

6. Start TWO elevated command prompts (as admin) and...
- if you are using 64 bit OS version navigate to c:\ms\TTT\amd64\TTD
- if you are using 64 bit OS version navigate to c:\ms\TTT\x86\TTD

7. In one of the elevated command prompts, started in the step 6 run:
lsass_idna_start.cmd

8. Create the issue you are trying to capture.

9. In the 2nd elevated command prompt, started in the step 6 run:
lsass_idna_stop.cmd

10. Collect the data 
File names will be lsass01.run and lsass01.out (the number in the file name can vary if tttracer has been executed several times on a same process)
If you are running 64 bit OS version, lsass01.run and lsass01.out will be stored in c:\ms\TTT\amd64\TTD
If you are running 32 bit OS version, lsass01.run and lsass01.out will be stored in c:\ms\TTT\x86\TTD

11. Zip lsass01.run and lsass01.out (the number in the file name can vary if tttracer has been executed several times on a same process) and upload to file transfer workspace.
