# Usage

## Start traces
UXTrace can capture traces(WPP/ETW/Tracelogging/Telemetry) for Windows component. To start logging the trace, use '-Start -<ComponentName> -<ComponentName> ...' like below example. After the trace stops, if the component has function for data collection or diag function, these are also called automatically. For example, WinRM has function for both data collection and diag. In this case, '.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start WinRM' triggers capturing trace + data collection for WinRM + diagnosis for WinRM. Also the supported trace component can be shown with 'UXTrace.ps1 -List'.
1. Start trace for multiple windows component. Below example shows start traces for AppX, StartMenu and COM component at the same time. This option is used for scenario where you can reproduce the issue immediately.(start trace -> repro -> stop trace) Also OS basic log and component log correspoding to the trace switch are collected automatically when stopping the trace.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -AppX -StartMenu -COM
```

2. If you want to start traces but let the prompt return, you can use '-Nowait'. This option is intended for a scenario where you cannot repro the issue intentionally and need to wait for next occurrence with trace enabled.(Start trace -> wait for repro -> Stop trace after repro)

```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -AppX -StartMenu -COM -NoWait
// Prompt returns immediately then wait for repro
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Stop
```

3. Start trace and save data to specified fodler(-LogFolderName). By default, UXTrace save log to 'MSLOG' folder on your desktop but if you want to change the log folder, use this option.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -AppX -StartMenu -COM -LogFolderName C:\temp
```

## Start WPR 
1. You can start WPR from UXTrace with '-WPR <ProfileName>'.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WPR General
```
Currently below profile is supported
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WPR Network
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WPR Graphic
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WPR XAML
```

2. You can set Boottrace for WPR by setting '-SetAutologger' in case need to start log from system boot
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -SetAutoLogger -WPR General
```

## Start Procmon
1. Start capturing procmon log with 'General' counter set
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -Procmon
```
2. By default, uxtrace searches desktop and under 'c:\program files' for location of procmon.exe. In case customer don't want to place the procmon.exe to desktop, you can use this option to set procmon path.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -Procmon -ProcmonPath C:\temp
```
3. In case you use -ProcmonPath with -SetAutologger, also need to specify -ProcmonPath when you stop autologger.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -SetAutologger -Procmon -ProcmonPath C:\temp
Restart-Computer
.\UXTrace.ps1 -StopAutologger -ProcmonPath C:\temp
```
## Capture packet
1. You can start capturing packet with '-Netsh' option
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -Netsh
```
## Start multiple traces and other diag tools(WPR, Procmon, Netsh, etc) at the same time
This would be most common usage in actual field operation. UXTrace exists to provide this scenario. You can start multiple diagnostic traces and tools at the same time.

1. To start multiple traces at the same time, you can just set all options you want to capture. This example shows how to start appx, startmenu and com traces and also wpr with general profile, procmon, packet capture(-netsh), and PSR(problem steps recorder). In addition to this, OS basic log is collected automatically.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -AppX -StartMenu -COM -WPR General -Procmon -Netsh -PSR
```

## Start diagnosis
You can run diag function implemeted in UXTrace. Currently we only have diag function for WinRM.
1. To start the diag function, use -StartDiag <ComponentName>.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -StartDiag <ComponentName>,<ComponentName>,...
Ex: .\UXTrace.ps1 -StartDiag WinRM
```
## List component name that has diag function
1. To see which component has diag function, run UXTrace with -ListSupportedDiag.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -ListSupportedDiag
```

## Start network scenario trace
1. The scenario trace can be started with -NetshScenario <ScenarioName>. The supported 'ScenarioName' is listed with -ListSupoortedNetshScenario.

```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -NetshScenario <ScenarioName>

Ex: .\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -NetshScenario InternetClient_dbg
```
Supported 'ScenarioName' can be listed with -ListSupoortedNetshScenario
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -ListSupoortedNetshScenario

Supported scenarios for -NetshScnario are:
  - dhcp_wpp
  - dns_wpp
  - dot3_wpp
  - InternetClient_dbg
  - InternetClient_wpp
  - InternetServer_dbg
  - InternetServer_wpp
  - ipsec_dbg
  - nat
  - nat_dbg
  - ndis_wpp
  - netsec
  - netsec_dbg
  - nid_wpp
  - provisioning
  - SmbClient_wpp
  - SmbServer_wpp
  - VpnClient
  - VpnClient_dbg
  - VpnClient_dbgEx
  - wcn_dbg
  - wcn_wpp
  - WirelessDisplay
  - wireless_dbg
  - wlan_dbg
  - wlan_wpp
  - wns_client
  - wns_dbg
  - wwan_dbg
  - wwan_wpp
```

2. You can also start multiple scenario trace by specifying comma-separated scenario name.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -NetshScenario <ScenarioName,ScenarioName,...>
Ex: .\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -NetshScenario wlan_wpp,wlan_dbg,wireless_dbg
```
3. Start scenario trace without capturing packet(-NoPacket)
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -NetshScenario <SenarioName> -NoPacket

Ex: .\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -NetshScenario InternetClient_dbg -NoPacket
```
4. List supported scenario trace(-ListSupportedNeshScenario)
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -ListSupoortedNetshScenario
Supported scenarios for -NetshScnario are:
  - dhcp_wpp
  - DirectAccess_DBG
  - dns_wpp
```
## Capture TTD(-TTD/-TTDPath/-TTDOnlaunch)

We support both inbox TTD and MS internal TTD. To use inbox TTD, use -TTD switch like below example. When only -TTD is passed, tttracer.exe -attach is performed intarnally. 

**Requirements**
- Using inbox TTD is supported from Windows 10 RS5 or later
- You cannot use -TTD with -SetAutologger as we don't support TTTracer.exe -persistent yet.

```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -TTD [PID|<ProcessName>|<ServiceName>]
```

1. Start TTD by specifying PID
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -TTD <PID>
Ex: .\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -TTD 3364
```

2 Start TTD by specifying process name
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -TTD <ProcessName>

Ex: .\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -TTD Explorer.exe
```
If there are multiple instances of the process, you will see below message and need to specify PID of the process you want to attach.
```
PS C:\Users\test\Desktop> .\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -TTD explorer.exe
Processing below traces:
    - TTD trace

Found multiple processes below.
-----------------------------------------
- explorer(PID:3004 User:DOMAIN-C\test)
- explorer(PID:4760 User:DOMAIN-C\test)
-----------------------------------------
Enter PID of process you want to attach: 3004 <---- Enter PID for the process you want to attach
```
3. Start TTD by specifying service name
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -TTD <ServiceName>

Ex: .\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WMI -TTD winmgmt
```

4. Start TTD with onLaunch option.
You can start TTD with -onLaunch option by specifying -TTDOnlaunch
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -TTD [<ProcessName>|<PackageName>|<ServiceName>] -TTDOnlaunch 

Ex: 
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WMI -TTD notepad.exe -TTDOnlaunch               /// Process name
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WMI -TTD Microsoft.Windows.Photos -TTDOnlaunch  /// Package name
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WMI -TTD winmgmt -TTDOnlaunch                   /// Sevice name
```

In addition to above, we support MS internal TTD. If you have the internal TTD passed from MS support, you can use it by specifying -TTDPath.

If internal TTD(PartnerTTDRecorder_x86_x64.zip) is extracted on desktop, you can start the internal TTD like this.

5. Start TTD using MS internal TTD
```
1. Extract PartnerTTDRecorder_x86_x64.zip to your desktop. 

2. Run UXTrace with -TTDPath to use the internal TTD

  .\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -TTD [PID|<ProcessName>|<ServiceName>] -TTDPath $env:userprofile
   Note: UXTrace searches tttracer.exe recursively, so you can set parent and upper folder to -TTDPath.

Ex)
Attaching TTD to running process(TTTracer.exe -Attach case):
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WMI -TTD notepad.exe -TTDPath $env:userprofile               /// Process name
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WMI -TTD Microsoft.Windows.Photos -TTDPath $env:userprofile  /// Package name
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WMI -TTD winmgmt -TTDPath $env:userprofile                   /// Sevice name

Start TTD when process or service starts(TTTracer.exe -Onlaunch case):
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WMI -TTD notepad.exe -TTDPath $env:userprofile -TTDOnlaunch               /// Process name
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WMI -TTD Microsoft.Windows.Photos -TTDPath $env:userprofile -TTDOnlaunch  /// Package name
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -WMI -TTD winmgmt -TTDPath $env:userprofile -TTDOnlaunch                   /// Sevice name
```

## Set autologger for traces(-SetAutoLogger)
We support autologger setting for ETW, WPR(boottrace), Procmon(bootlogging), netsh(Persistent). To set autolloger, you can use '-SetAutologger' option. If you specify option other than trace(ex -AppX), -WPR, -Procmon and -Netsh with -SetAutolloger, you will get an error.

1. Set autologger(-SetAutoLogger) 
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -SetAutoLogger -AppX -StartMenu -WPR -Netsh -Procmon
```
2. Set autologger -> restart computer -> Stop traces and delete autologger.(-StopAutoLogger)
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -SetAutoLogger -AppX -Photo -WPR -Netsh -Procmon
.\Restart-Computer
.\UXTrace.ps1 -StopAutoLogger   /// This will stop all traces and delete autologger settings
```

## Set log folder for autologger(-AutologgerFolderName)
By default, log folder for autologger is C:\Temp as profile is not loaded at boot timing. But if you want to change the log folder for autologger, you can use -AutologgerFolderName. Please don't specify path under profile like under c:\Users'
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -SetAutoLogger -AppX -Photo -WPR -Netsh -Procmon -AutologgerFolderName [Log folder name]

Ex:
.\UXTrace.ps1 -SetAutoLogger -AppX -Photo -WPR -Netsh -Procmon -AutologgerFolderName D:\MSDATA
```

## Delete autologger settings(-DeleteAutologger)
1. To delete autolloger settings, run UXTrace with -DeleteAutologger. You don't need restart of the system for the change to take effect.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -DeleteAutoLogger
```
## Start performance log(-Start -Perf [CounterSetName])
UXTrace supports performance monitor and currently only 4 perf conter sets are supported but we will implement more counter set in the future. Current supported counter set is 'General','SMB','RDS' and 'HyperV'. You can see detailed perf counter name by running '.\UXTrace.ps1 -ListSupportedPerfCounter'.
1. Start capturing performance counter with 'General' counter set.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -Perf General
```

2. If you want to change interval for the performance log, use '-PerfInterval'. The unit is second.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -Perf General -PerfInterval 1   // 1 sec interval
```
## List supported performance counter set name(-ListSupportedPerfCounter)
1. List supported performance counter set name that can be set with -Perf.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -ListSupportedPerfCounter
```

## Start PSR(Problem Steps Recorder)(-Start -PSR)
1. You can start PSR with '-PSR' option.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -Shel -PSR
```

## Collect component specific log and OS basic log(-CollectLog <ComponentName>)
In case you don't need trace and just need logs for basic OS log or component logs/settings, you can use '-Collectlog' switch. If the component has diag function like WinRM, the diag function is also performed automatically.

1. To collect OS basic log like OS version or IP address and so on, you can specify '-Collectlog Basic'
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -CollectLog Basic
```
2. To collect OS basic log and component log/settings, please specify component name with comma separated.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -CollectLog Basic,AppX,Shell,Logon
```
3. Collect data and save it to specified folder.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -CollectLog Shell,logon,basic -LogFolderName C:\temp
```

## List supported component log
To list supported component logs, use -ListSupportedLog.
```
PS> .\UXTrace.ps1 -ListSupportedLog
The following logs are supported
    - AppCompat
    - AppX
    - IME
    - Logon
    - Print
    - Shell
    - Task
    - UEV
    - WinRM
    - WMI
    - Basic

Usage:
  .\UXTrace.ps1 -CollectLog [ComponentName,ComponentName,...]
  Example: .\UXTrace.ps1 -CollectLog AppX,Basic
```

## Enable WER setting(-Set / -Unset)
Currently we only support WER setting. You enable WER with '-Set WER'.
1. Enable WER setting
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Set WER
```

2. Disable WER setting
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Unset WER
```

## Enable SCM Trace
Enabling SCM trace is a bit not normal and need to set registry to enable debug log. To enable the trace, follow below step.

1. Enable SCM Trace
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -SCM -NoWait

/// Restart computer

.\UXTrace.ps1 -Stop -Compress -Delete  /// Stop trace after reboot and repro
```
## Create bat file that starts and stops traces(-CreateBatFile)
In case of Windows Server 2012 or earlier, UXTrace does not work as it supports from PowerShell v4. In this case, you can export commands that are issued from UXTrace to bat files. Two bat files for start and stop traces is created if you use CreateBatFile option.

1. Create bat file(Create bat file that contains commands issued from UXTrace)
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -CreateBatFile -Auth -WMI -WPR General -Procmon -Netsh -Perf -PSR
```
After you run above command, bat file named "UXTrace.cmd" is created in 'MSLOG' folder on your desktop

2. If you want to create a bat file for autologger, use '-CreateBatFile' with '-SetAutologger'
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -SetAutologger -CreateBatFile -Auth -WMI -WPR General -Procmon -Netsh
```
After you run above command, two bat files below are created in 'MSLOG' folder on your desktop
- SetAutologger.cmd
- StopAutologger.cmd

## Start traces with nowait mode(-NoWait)
In case you want command prompt to return immediately and stop trace after repro, you can use '-NoWait'. In this case, the powershell prompt returns right after starting the trace.

1. Start trace with nowait mode. In this case, you need to run 'uxtrace.ps1 -stop' to stop the trace
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -AppX -StartMenu -COM -NoWait

// Reproduce issue

.\UXTrace.ps1 -Stop
```

## Set log folder(-LogFolderName)
You can change log folder(-LogFolderName). By default, UXTrace saves logs to 'MSLOG' folder on desktop which means under profile. In case you don't want to save large size of data to profile, please use this option.

1. This example shows save traces to C:\temp.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -Shell -LogFolderName C:\temp

// Reproduce issue

.\UXTrace.ps1 -Stop
```
2. Collect data to specified fodler.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -CollectLog Shell,logon,basic -LogFolderName C:\temp
```

## Compress and delete log folder(-Compress / -Delete)
-Compress switch compresses log folder after stopping trace or collecting data. By default -Compress does not remove original log folder and it remains. If you want to remove the original log folder, use -delete option to remove it after compressing it.
1. Compress log folder after stopping traces(-Compress)
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -start -Photo -Compress
    or 
.\UXTrace.ps1 -start -Photo -NoWait  // Don't set -Compress when use with -NoWait
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Stop -Compress
    or
.\UXTrace.ps1 -SetAutologger -Photo
.\UXTrace.ps1 -StopAutoLogger -Compress
```        
2. If you want to delete log folder after compressing log folder and creating .zip file, you can delete original log folder using -Delete.
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -start -Photo -Compress -Delete
```

## Save multiple trace data to one etl file(-AsOneTrace)
To capture multiple traces and save the data to one etl file, not multiple etl files, you can use '-AsOneTrace' option. Sometimes you may want to merge etl files to one etl file to see log sequentially, this option is intended for such scenario.

1. Start traces and save traces to one etl file(-AsOneTrace)
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -AppX -StartMenu -COM -AsOneTrace
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Stop
```
Note: After running above command, all traces are saved to one etl file named 'UXTrace.etl'

## List supported traces(-List)
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -List
The following traces are supported:
    - Alarm: Alarm app tracing
    - AppCompat: AppCompat and UAC tracing
    - AppV: App-V tracing
    - AppX: AppX tracing
        :

The following commands are supported:
    - Perf: Performance monitor
    - Procmon: Process monitor(procmon.exe)
    - PSR: Problem Steps Recorder
    - Netsh: Netsh(Packet capture)
    - NetshScenario: Netsh client scenario trace + Packet capture
    - SCM: Setting SCM trace
    - WPR: Windows Performance Recoder(wpr.exe)
```
## List supported component log(-ListSupportedLog)
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -ListSupportedLog

Ex:
PS C:\Users\test\Desktop> .\UXTrace.ps1 -ListSupportedLog
The following logs are supported
    - AppCompat
    - AppX
    - IME
    - Logon
    - Print
    - Shell
    - Task
    - UEV
    - WinRM
    - WMI
    - Basic

Usage:
  .\UXTrace.ps1 -CollectLog [ComponentName,ComponentName,...]
  Example: .\UXTrace.ps1 -CollectLog AppX,Basic
```
## Show current trace status(-Status)
If you want to see what traces are currently running or if autologger traces are set or not, '-Status' shows you current trace status. This command is also helpful when you encounter an error during starting trace or setting autologger. In such case, you may want to see if trace is started and if is, should want to stop it. To do this, run with -Status and if you see the running traces in output of -status, run 'UXTrace.ps1 -stop' to stop them. 
```
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Status

Running ETW trace session:
Below traces are currently running:
    - COMTrace with 16 providers
    - AppXTrace with 61 providers
    - StartMenuTrace with 19 providers
    - Procmon
    - WPR
    - Netsh(packet capture)
    - PSR(Problem Steps Recorder)

Autologger session enabled:
    There is no autologger session enabled.

Show help message(-Help)
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Help or Get-Help .\UXTrace.ps1
```

## Stop collecting OS basic log(-NoBasicLog)
By default, UXTrace collects OS basic log automatically when stopping trace and -Collectlog is specifed. But if you don't need the OS log, please specify -NoBasicLog to not collect the log.
```
1. Start traces without OS basic log
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -Shell -AppX -NoBasicLog

2. Start traces with -NoWait and stop without OS basic log
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -Shell -AppX -NoWait
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Stop -NoBasicLog

3. Start traces with autologger and stop without OS basic log
.\UXTrace.ps1 -SetAutologger -Shell -AppX
Restart-Computer
.\UXTrace.ps1 -StopAutologger -NoBasicLog

4. Collect component log/settings without OS basic log
.\UXTrace.ps1 -CollectLog shell,wmi -NoBasicLog
```

## Special option for COM debugging(-EnableCOMDebug)
There are existing trace switch for COM(-COM) but if you need more debug log for it, you can set -EnableCOMDebug with -COM for detailed
```
1. Start COM traces with debug flag.
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -COM -EnableCOMDebug
   or
.\UXTrace.ps1 -Start -COM -EnableCOMDebug -NoWait
