Credential Roaming Utility (CRU) 
The goal of the Credential Roaming Tool is to provide our customers and Microsoft employees the possibility to troubleshoot Credential Roaming. Use this tool to extract configuration data for Credential Roaming (DIMS), to analyze credential roaming tokens locally, in Credential Roaming AD Objects/Attributes and in AD LVR data and to check and compare client and AD settings. 


Installation steps: 
Copy all files, provided in the tool download zip file cru_180227.zip, in folder named c:\tools\cru
Start powershell as admin, cd to c:\tools\cru and execute install_cru.bat
For easy and fast data collection use the batch files (target DC name and, if running in admin mode, target username must be updated) provided in download zip file getdata_in_usercontext.bat and getdata_in_admincontext.bat. Both Batch files must be executed as admin.

Alternatively, you can install/register cmdlets separately by running the following commands:
PS C:\tools\cru> .\cru.ps1 -installcmdlet
PS C:\tools\cru> .\cru.ps1 -installcmdlet CredRoamLocalUserData
PS C:\tools\cru> .\cru.ps1 -installcmdlet CredRoamADUserData
PS C:\tools\cru> .\cru.ps1 -installcmdlet CredRoamLVRData


Usage Samples 
The tool contains two “parts”:
On the one hand the script can be run without installing the DLLs on a machine in order to collect Credential Roaming configuration data on a client (currently the "dumpconfig" and "eventlog" switches)
On the other hand the script can be pointed to specific Domain Controllers in order to get the values of Credential Roaming attributes into a “human readable” form.

The tool can be executed in user context (the user you currently troubleshoot) or in admin context (admin can have access only to users data in AD).
The following two batch files (included in the tool download zip file) are recommended for data collection:
getdata_in_usercontext.bat
getdata_in_admincontext.bat
Target DC name and, if running in admin mode, target username must be updated.
Both batch files must be executed as admin.

Here are some samples for standalone execution:
PS C:\tools\cru> .\cru.ps1 -dumpconfig local
PS C:\tools\cru> .\cru.ps1 -getcredroamlocaluserdata filesystem
PS C:\tools\cru> .\cru.ps1 -getcredroamlocaluserdata statefile
PS C:\tools\cru> .\cru.ps1 -getcredroamstatus compare
PS C:\tools\cru> .\cru.ps1 -getcredroamstatus all
PS C:\tools\cru> .\cru.ps1 -eventlog enable
PS C:\tools\cru> .\cru.ps1 -eventlog disable
PS C:\tools\cru> .\cru.ps1 -eventlog export
