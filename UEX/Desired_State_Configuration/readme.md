Open an administrative PowerShell prompt and go to that folder\
Execute .\DSC-Collect.ps1\
The script will create a subfolder with the results, please compress the folder and upload it into the workspace\
If the script does not start, complaining about execution policy, then use Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned to change it.​
