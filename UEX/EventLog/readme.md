Description:
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​PowerShell script to simplify the collection of data related to EventLog troubleshooting and make our action plans easier.​

The list of WMI performance classes\

The export of the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\
The export of the Application, EventTracing and System logs\
The details of the Application, System and Security logs\
The permissions on the folder C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\
The permissions and the content of the folder C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\WMI\RtBackup​\
The list of the files in %windir%\System32\winevt\Logs\
The output of the command logman -ets query "EventLog-Application"\

The output of the command logman query -ets\
The output of the command wevtutil el\
The output of the command auditpol /get /category:*\
The list of the installed hotfixes​\
The system information\

Customer-friendly action plan:
Save the attached file Evt-Collect.ps1.txt on a folder on the C: driver as Evt-Collect.ps1\
Open an administrative PowerShell prompt and go to that folder\
Execute .\Evt-Collect.ps1\
The script will create a subfolder with the results, please compress the folder and upload it into the workspace\
If the script does not start, complaining about execution policy, then use Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned to change it.​
