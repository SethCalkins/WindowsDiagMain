copy start_CA.txt and stop_CA.txt to target and rename with .bat extensions
From an elevated command prompt (as admin), navigate to the c:\ms directory and run start-auth.bat to start the tracing

Create the issue you are trying to capture.

From an elevated command prompt (as admin), navigate to the c:\ms directory and run stop-auth.bat to stop the tracing.
