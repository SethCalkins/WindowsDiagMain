# GetRemoteToken

## Description

GetRemoteToken dumps security tokens of AD domain member machines and users on the target/resource machine without knowing the password of client machines or users.
GetRemoteToken can be used to dump the token of AD domain member machines and users. It must be executed on domain joined machine.
The tool works within a single forest and also over forest trust.
GetRemoteToken will display Kerberos claims (if there are any) in token.
Output resembles to whoami output (it is intentional), but it does not require interactive logon and knowledge of user's or machine's password.


## IMPORTANT
This tool is provided as it is without any support and warranty!!!


## Usage:

 GetRemoteToken -u:<fqdn_of_the_user | fqdn_of_the_machine> [-v]

  -v            - Optional switch for verbose output of token's groups and privileges 

  -?            - This message

## Examples: 

  GetRemoteToken -u:MachineAccount@contoso.com

  GetRemoteToken -u:MachineAccount.contoso.com

  GetRemoteToken -u:UserAccount@contoso.com

  GetRemoteToken -u:UserAccount.contoso.com


Scenario:
- Service on cont-mem.contoso.com runs as local system and tries to access resources on target machine fab-mem.fabrikam.com
- You need to know group membership and rights assignment that cont-mem.contoso.com will get after establishing remote logon to fab-mem.fabrikam.com
- To get this answered, you logon to to fab-mem.fabrikam.com (using normal user account), start cmd.exe and execute "getremotetoken -u:cont-mem.contoso.com" and you will get the desired information: 

GetRemoteToken.exe -u:cont-mem.contoso.com
