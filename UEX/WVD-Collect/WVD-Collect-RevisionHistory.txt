**WVD-Collect Revision History**

Version number / Change Notes

v201219.7:

[WVD-Collect changes]
* Added Get-Help information. You can now read more information about the tool and available parameters by running "Get-Help .\WVD-Collect.ps1 -Full"
* Added logic to disable quick edit mode (if it's enabled) as sometimes this causes the script to stop working until enter key is pressed (and if needed, enable it again when the script finished collecting data)
* The "-Profile" parameter has been renamed to "-Profiles"
* The "-ClientAutoTrace" parameter has been renamed to "-Client"
* When executed using the "-Client" parameter, the tool will now also check if "msrdc.exe" is still running and if yes, it will ask to close it in order to collect the latest client ETL trace too. If you select "Y", it will disconnect all active WVD connections on the client. If you select "N", the tool will continue without disconnecting active WVD connections, but the latest WVD Desktop client ETL trace may not be collected.
* The Geneva Scheduled Tasks information are now collected under the "*_ScheduledTasks" subfolder
* Networking information are now collected under the "*_Networking" subfolder
* Common system information are now collected under the "*_SystemInfo" subfolder
* Certificates  information are now collected under the "*_Certificates" subfolder
* Now collecting also:
	* .NET Framework information under the *_SystemInfo.txt file (especially useful for scenarios where the agent may fail to upgrade due to outdated .Net version)
	* Registry key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\" under "*_RegistryKeys\*_reg_SW-MS-NetFS-NDP.txt" file
	* C:\Windows\SysWOW64\*.sys file version information under "*_ver_SysWOW64_SYS.txt"
* When executed with the "-Profiles" parameter, it now also collects the following event logs:
	* FSLogix-Apps/Admin
	* FSLogix-Apps/Operational
* Updated disclaimer
* Minor code improvements

[WVD-Diag changes]
* Added check for RDP ShortPath configuration (Windows 10 and Server OS hosts)
* Added check for current and previous WVD Agent and Stack versions and their installation dates (Windows 10 and Server OS hosts)
* Added check for Windows Instaler service start type (If you disable Windows Installer, the service won't be able to install agent updates on your session hosts, and your session hosts won't function properly.)
* When executed using the "-Profiles" parameter, the tool will also check for the presence of the recommended Windows Defender Antivirus exclusion values


v201110.3:
* Added a new command line parameter "-DiagOnly". 
	When executed with this parameter (even if other parameters are also included) the script will skip ALL data collection and will ONLY run the diagnostics part. 
	This is useful when you want to run only a quick Diag without collecting additional data.
	Important: To run diagnostics also for a specific scenario (like Profile troubleshooting), the corresponding command line parameter needs to be present too.
	E.g.: 
		"WVD-Collect -DiagOnly" will run only the default diagnostics
		"WVD-Collect -Profile -DiagOnly" will run the default diagnostics + "Profile"-specific diagnostics
* The script will now also collect:
	* "fltmc filters" output in the "\*_Fltmc.txt" file
	* the most recent C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\MonitoringAgent.log file
	* WVDAgent and WVDAgentManager registry keys and log files when ran on Windows 7 hosts
* When executed using the "-Profile" parameter:
	* the FSLogix specific logs (if present) will now be stored directly under the \*_FSLogix subfolder, instead of \*_LogFiles\FSLogix
	* the script will also collect:
		* "frx list-redirects" and "frx list-rules" output (if FSLogix is present) in the "\*_FSLogix\*_Frx-list.txt" file
		* Windows Defender Exclusions registry keys for Extensions, Paths and Processes under the \*_RegistryKeys folder
* Merged output of "Get-DscConfiguration" and "Get-DscConfigurationStatus" into one file *_Get-DscConfiguration.txt
* Fixed an issue that was preventing the Geneva Scheduled Task information to be collected from Windows 10/Server 2012R2+ machines.
* Fixed some errors when running the script on Windows 7 hosts and newer PowerShell cmdlets were not available.
* [WVD-Diag] Improved detection of the active WVD listener, especially when there are multiple listener registry keys present. 
* [WVD-Diag] Added check for the value of the "SessionDirectoryListener" registry key which contains information on the WVD listener currently in use.
* [WVD-Diag] Added check for "SSL Cipher Suite Order" configuration
* [WVD-Diag] Added StartType information to the checked services
* [WVD-Diag] Added status check for the "RdAgent" and "WinRM" services
* [WVD-Diag] Added status check for the "WVDAgent" and "WVDAgentManager" services when the script is executed on Windows 7 hosts
* [WVD-Diag] When executed using the "-Profile" parameter, the script will also check the status of the "frxsvc", "frxdrv", "frxccds", "OneDrive Updater Service" services
* Minor code and layout improvements


v201028.3:
* The script is now digitally signed with a Microsoft Code Signing certificate.
* Moved PSVersion collection from PSVersion.txt to SystemInfo.txt. 
	The PSVersion.txt will no longer be generated.
* Once data collection is complete, a File Explorer window will open pointing to the location containing the collected data
* [WVD-Diag] Added check if the RDSH role is installed on server OS hosts and log the result in WVD-Diag. 
	If the role is missing on server OS VMs, then installing the agent and registering the host in the host pool may fail.
* Updated WVD-Diag.txt layout
* Minor code fixes


v200912.0:
* Improved WVD Diagnostics functionality. The script will now also check and generate a report (WVD-Diag.txt) with:
	* status of key services
	* 'fEnableWinStation' registry key (host not available scenario)
	* 'DeleteUserAppContainersOnLogoff' registry key (FW rules bloating scenario)

* Hotfixes are now listed in descending order, with the most recently installed hotfix on top (Hotfixes.txt)
* Minor code fixes


v200722.2:
* Added command line parameter "-Teams" to collect Teams specific data for troubleshooting Teams WVD optimization issues (requires the script to run under the affected user's WVD session + the user to have pressed Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1 before running the script, to have generated the Teams diagnostics logs).
* Added additional confirmation prompt when launching the script with the "-Teams" parameter to get the user's confirmation that the prerequisites have been met before continuing
* When running the script with the "-Teams" parameter, besides the default WVD data, the following data will are also collected:
	* Teams logs file: %appdata%\Microsoft\Teams\logs.txt
